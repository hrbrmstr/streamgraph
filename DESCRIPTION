Description: A streamgraph (or "stream graph") is a type of stacked area graph
    which is displaced around a central axis, resulting in a flowing,
    organic shape. Streamgraphs were developed by Lee Byron and popularized
    by their use in a February 2008 New York Times article on movie
    box office revenues. [Wikipedia] The streamgraph package is based on
    the htmlwidget package and uses D3.js to render the visualizations.
